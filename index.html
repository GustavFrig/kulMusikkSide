                <p>
                    Tortuga is a website which I use to rate albums which I listen to. You
                    can use these ratings as an indicator to which albums that may be worth listening to.
                    However, it is crucial to realize that these are MY PERSONAL ratings, and that they are in no shape
                    or form objective.
                    I therefore strongly advice to not to take these ratings as law, but to even listen to
                    some of the albums I rate lowly. Just because I dont love it, doesnt mean you wont.

                <h1>What music to expect?</h1>
                <p>As a human, I have my tastes. Most of the albums on this will therefore 
                    be from my favorite genres, which are Hip-Hop, soul and rock. I therefore also
                    advise you to be more critical of the reviews I have on other genres, considering
                    that I have less experience with those genres.

                <h1>The rating system</h1>
                <p>The albums will be rated on a scale from 1-10, with 1 being the lowest score and 10 being the highest.
                    The albums with a different colored vinyl are the ones I recognise as the best of all time.</p>
